## About SleepLab
SleepLab is an application that can check sleep quality and the presence of sleep disorders via mobile phones based on age, occupation, duration of sleep, etc. In addition, our app provides advice for improving sleep quality and curing sleep disorders from experts in its field.

SleepLab is built in response to challenges related to undiagnosed sleep disorders. Our team recognizes that many individuals actually experience sleep disorders that can lead to decreased performance and health, and they lack access for proper checks. With SleepLab, the team aims to provide easier and more convenient access to identifying sleep disorders.
