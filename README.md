# MACHINE-LEARNING
The machine learning part of this capstone project is to create a machine learning model that can be used to predict whether a person has a sleep disorder or not.

## METHOD
Neural Network (NN)

## TOOLS
* Python
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* Keras
* Google Colab

## DATASET
Here is the dataset that we used to build our model: 
* [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

For this project, we reduce the variable so that we use:
* [Data Final](https://github.com/abdulrohman19/SleepLab/blob/machine-learning/Data/dataset.csv)

## HOW TO PREDICT
The model will predict the sleep disorder's presence through these factors:
* Sleep duration
* Physical activity level
* BMI category

## ML MODEL
* [sleeplab.py](https://github.com/abdulrohman19/SleepLab/blob/machine-learning/Data/sleeplab_ml.py)
