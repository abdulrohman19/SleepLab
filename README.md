# MACHINE-LEARNING
Machine Learning part in this capstone project is to create a machine learning model for a Sleep Disorder detection application.

# SLEEP LAB
SleepLab is an application that can check sleep quality and the presence of sleep disorders via mobile phones based on age, occupation, duration of sleep, etc. In addition, our app provides advice for improving sleep quality and curing sleep disorders from experts in its field.

# Dataset
There are dataset that we used to build our model: 
- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

and for this project we reduce the variable so that we use is:
- [DataFinal](https://github.com/abdulrohman19/SleepLab/blob/machine-learning/Data/dataset.csv)
